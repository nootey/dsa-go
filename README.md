# Go Data structures and algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using GoLang.
The goal is to implement as many as possible while learning and mastering GoLang.

Each implementation is accompanied by unit tests to ensure correctness.

To run the tests, you can use the following command.

```bash
go run RunTests.go
```

To run tests in a single directory, use the command.

```bash
# To run tests on the arrays directory
go run RunTests.go ./structures/arrays
```
